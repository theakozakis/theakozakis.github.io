      <p>
	 I am a strong believer that it's very important to educate the general public (especially kids!) about science and astronomy, and make an effort to participate in science outreach whenever possible!
	      I'm always very open to being a part of school science events and giving public talks.  Below are a few of the outreach events I was involved with in the past. 
	      I hope to become involved in new outreach events in Spain soon, too! Most likely after I improve my Spanish skills :)
	      In Denmark I've recently connected with <a href="http://astronomyontap.org/locations/copenhagen-denmark/">Astronomy on Tap in Copenhagen</a>, so info on that is coming soon!    </p>


	<p> <h2> Astronomy on Tap Copenhagen Chapter (organizer 2021-2023)</h2></p>
	<img align="middle" src="/img/aot_copenhagen.png" alt="Astronomy on Tap Copenhagen logo">
	  <p>While in Denmark I was a part of the <a href="http://astronomyontap.org/locations/copenhagen-denmark/">Astronomy on Tap Copenhagen chapter</a> both as a presenter and organizer. 
		  Astronomy on Tap in an international program hosting astronomy outreach events in bars across the world, allowing scientists to interact with locals in an informal environment. 
		  In our Copenhagen chapter we sourced our speakers primarily from the University of Copenhagen, the Niels Bohr Institute, and the Technical University of Denmark, and offered monthly talks on a range of topics.
		  Talks were given in English in order to allow international scientists from local Danish insitutes to share their knowledge with the general public. 
		  You can check if there is an Astronomy on Tap chapter near you <a href="https://astronomyontap.org/locations/">here</a>! And if there isn't, you can always contact them and start your own!

	  <p> <h2> Ask An Astronomer (volunteer 2013 - 2020)</h2></p>
	<img align="middle" src="/img/aaa.jpg" alt="Ask An Astronomer front page">
	  <p>Cornell's Ask An Astronomer <a href="http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/">website</a> is a place where curious members of the general public can submit any question they want to be answered by an astronomer.  In addition to answering online questions throughout my time as a graduate student, I also particpated in related events such as Ask An Astronomer Live at a local Ithaca bar with Science Cabaret, and mulitple Reddit AMAs.</p>

	   <p> <h2>Museum in the Dark(coordinator 2014 - 2017, volunteer 2013-2019)</h2></p>
	    <img align="middle" src="/img/mote.png" alt="Museum of the Earth Logo" width=70%>
	  </p>Held at the Paleontological Research Institution's Museum of the Earth, this yearly event is typically held the Tuesday before Halloween and is open to the general public.  Our astronomy themed demos include liquid nitrogen ice cream, infrared cameras, rockets, along with many others, all run by graduate student volunteers.  Costumes are encouraged for both volunteers and participants, and there is alway an excess of candy!</p>
    
	  <p> <h2> 4 H Career Explorations Astronomy Workshop (coordinator 2015 -  2017, volunteer 2014-2019) </h2>
	  Career Explorations is a three day 4-H program is run every summer at Cornell University with a variety of workshops being offered for youth entering 10th-12th grade.  The astronomy workshop covers a wide range of topics ranging from the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, to building and launching your own mini rocket over the three day period.</p>

	<p> <h2> Expanding Your Horizons (workshop designer and leader 2015 - 2020) </h2>
	Expanding Your Horizons is an yearly event held at Cornell for middle school girls interested in STEM fields.  For the past two years the Astronomy department has run an exoplanet workshop that was co-designed by me and several other graduate students and post docs.</p>		
				
	<p> Our workshop teaches about exoplanet detection and light curves using our very own lego model and arduino light detectors.  We also introduce the participants to the citizen science project planethunters.org and encourage them to re-visit the site even after the event is over!</p>
